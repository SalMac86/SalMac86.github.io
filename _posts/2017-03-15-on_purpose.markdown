Have you ever had that feeling you weren't quite living up to your potential? Like the color had started to seep out of your life? 

I decided the only way to get rid of that feeling was to dive into my passion!

Software Development, Computer Science, Technology, LEARNING!!!

This is why I have a blog today. . . 

Because I decided to invest in myself and start on the Learn.co Community Powered Boot Camp.

I'm LOVING IT!!!
